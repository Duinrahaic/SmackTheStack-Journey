# SmackTheStack-Journey
This is my Journey though the site smackthestack.org a interactive wargames plaground. I will document what I learn, find, and my final solution if possible.  

<b>What is Smash the Stack?</b>

The Smash the Stack Wargaming Network hosts several Wargames. A Wargame in our context can be described as an ethical hacking environment that supports the simulation of real world software vulnerability theories or concepts and allows for the legal execution of exploitation techniques. Software can be an Operating System, network protocol, or any userland application.
