+Logged into the io.smasthstack.org server with putty. 
+Started as a level01 user meaing I only have access as a generic user and cannot access level02 or higher levels.
+cd/levels brought me to all the levels that are on this server
+using ./ I am able to execute (run) a level. For example ./level01 gives me the first level
+Executing ./level01 for the first time we are confronted with a three digit passcode.
+Attemps 001,123,000, and 111 did not work.
+After some research I was able to see that there was a debugger (gdb) where I can see the code run without modifying or being able to view the soruce code.
#gdb level01        <--- Runs GDB on specific file
(gdb)       <----------- Now shows I'm in the debugger
(gdb) run level01     <- Executes (runs) level01 as if I were outside the debugger and using ./level01
(gdb) disass main     <- All programs have some form of a main loop so were are able to disassemble the main program.
      Dump of assembler code for function main:
         0x08048080 <+0>:     push   $0x8049128
         0x08048085 <+5>:     call   0x804810f <puts>
         0x0804808a <+10>:    call   0x804809f <fscanf>
         0x0804808f <+15>:    cmp    $0x10f,%eax
         0x08048094 <+20>:    je     0x80480dc <YouWin>
         0x0804809a <+26>:    call   0x8048103 <exit>
