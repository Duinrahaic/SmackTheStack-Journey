+Logged into the io.smasthstack.org server with putty. 
+Started as a level01 user meaing I only have access as a generic user and cannot access level02 or higher levels.
+cd/levels brought me to all the levels that are on this server
+using ./ I am able to execute (run) a level. For example ./level01 gives me the first level
+Executing ./level01 for the first time we are confronted with a three digit passcode.
+Attemps 001,123,000, and 111 did not work.
+After some research I was able to see that there was a debugger (gdb) where I can see the code run without modifying or being able to view the soruce code.
